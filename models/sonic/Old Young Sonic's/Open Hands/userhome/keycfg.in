; This file is used to change key bindings for Misfit Model 3D.
;
; To change keyboard shortcuts, add keyboard shortcuts assignments at the bottom 
; of this file. The format for keyboard shortcuts is:
;
;    mm3d_command_name  MODIFIER+Key
;
; For a full list of MM3D command names, see keycfg.out. The keycfg.out file
; is written at the end of every MM3D session and includes all the currently
; assigned shortcuts (including default values and user-specified values).
;
; There can be as many spaces between the command name and the keyboard shortcut
; as you want, but there cannot be any spaces in the keyboard shortcut sequence.
;
; Valid modifiers are:
;
;   Ctrl
;   Alt
;   Shift
;   Meta
;
; Modifiers are not case-sensitive. You can have as many modifiers as you want 
; (none, all, or any combination).
;
; Most keys can be entered by typing the actual key (letters, numbers, arithmatic
; operators, etc).
;
; Some special keys:
;
;   Del
;   PgDown
;   PgUp
